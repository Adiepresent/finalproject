Life in the Internet age: The Changing Nature of Social Relations 

Social relations are a fundamental aspect of human life. Durkheim, and early sociologist, tried to understand the relationship between individuality (what makes up a person’s identity) and society. He suggested that society exerted a powerful force on individuals. People’s norms, beliefs, and values make up a collective consciousness, or a shared way of understanding and behaving in the world. The collective consciousness binds individuals together and creates social integration.
Society is a social product created by the actions of individuals that then exert a coercive social force back on those individuals

Durkheim was writing in the early 1900s. One of these primary goals was to analyze how societies could maintain social integration after traditional bonds of family and church were replaced by modem economic relations. 

In the past, simple societies were comprised of people connected to others because of close personal ties and traditions (e.g., family and religion). The first challenge to this form of social interaction was posed by the increased modernization of the economy. Modern societies, unlike simple societies, are based on organic solidarity, in which people are connected by their reliance on others in the division of labor. 

Now, in the Postmodern World, our understanding of social relations is once again being challenged. This time by the age of the internet. 
Social relations, although basic to human nature, health and well-being, have become increasingly complicated as a result of changing population demography and technology; technological developments are fundamentally changing the ways in which we experience social relations. 

People are no longer confined to relationships with people who share the same personal individual characteristics as them (such as age, gender, race, and religion). The transition from in-person contact to electronic contact has altered the natural contact frequency. Studies have shown an increased level of intergenerational contact. 

The internet age as changed communication. Individuals and groups can interact in previously unimaginable ways. (More frequently and with people who do not match any of their individual characteristics). But I wonder, has this transformation fundamentally changed human relationships? Are we better off? Worse off? Or has there been no fundamental change? 
 
This change did not have to change the fundamental nature of human relationships (the desire to rely on and be relied on). If anything, the internet has the potential to enhance the fundamental nature of human relationships. Maybe it is the conventions that have taken over the web that have distorted human interactions. The masks that use online hinder our ability to benefit from this advanced form of communication.
